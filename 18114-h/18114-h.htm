<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

<p>
Now that the Presidential elections
are over it is hoped that any Irish-Americans
who joined the Sinn Fein
murder-gang for electioneering purposes
will go home again.</p>

       <hr class="short" />
<p>
Owing to pressure on space, due
among other things to the American
election, the net sale controversy in
one of our contemporaries was held
over on Wednesday last. We are quite
sure that neither Senator <span class="sc">Harding</span> nor
Mr. <span class="sc">Cox</span> was aware of his responsibility
in the matter.</p>

       <hr class="short" />
<p>
Lord <span class="sc">Howard de Walden</span> says, "I
would rather trust a crossing-sweeper
with an appreciation of
music than a man who
comes from a public school."
We agree. The former is
much more likely to have
been a professional musician
in his time.</p>

       <hr class="short" />
<p>
The mystery of the Scottish
golf club that was recently
inundated with applications
for membership is
now explained. It appears
that a caddy refused a tip
of sixpence offered him by
one of the less affluent members,
and the story somehow
leaked out.</p>

       <hr class="short" />
<p>
At one Hallowe'en dinner
held in London the haggis
was ten minutes late. It is
said that it had had trouble
with a dog on the way and
had come off second best.</p>

       <hr class="short" />
<p>
The man who was heard
last week to say that he had no idea that
Mrs. <span class="sc">Asquith</span> had published a book of
memoirs has now, on the advice of his
friends, consented to see a doctor.</p>

       <hr class="short" />
<p>
The clergy of Grays, in Essex, are
advocating the abolition of Sunday
funerals. It is said that quite a
number of strict Sabbatarians have a
rooted objection to being buried on
the Sabbath.</p>

       <hr class="short" />
<p>
According to an evening paper hawthorn
buds have been plucked at
Hornsey. We don't care.</p>

       <hr class="short" />
<p>
A Liberal Independent writes to ask
if the Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span>, who has been
elected Lord Rector of Edinburgh
University, is the well-known Prime
Minister of that name.</p>

       <hr class="short" />
<p>
A firm of music publishers have produced
what they describe as a three-quarter
one-step. It will soon be impossible
to go to a dance without
being accompanied by a professional
arithmetician.</p>

       <hr class="short" />
<p>
It seems that high prices have even
put an end to the chicken that used to
cross the road.</p>

       <hr class="short" />
<p>
"Only through poverty," says Mr.
<span class="sc">Maurice Hewlett</span>, "will England
thrive." As a result of this statement
we understand that several profiteers
have decided to get down to it once
again.</p>

       <hr class="short" />
<p>
A Japanese arrested at Hull was
found to have seven revolvers and two
thousand rounds of ammunition on him.
It was pointed out to him that the War
was over long ago.</p>

       <hr class="short" />
<p>
A contemporary refers to a romance
which ended in marriage. Alas! how
often this happens.</p>

       <hr class="short" />
<p>
The United States Government has
decided to recognise the present Mexican
Government. Mexican bandits say they
had better take a good look at them
while there is yet time.</p>

       <hr class="short" />
<p>
A Prohibitionist asserts that Scotland
will be dry in five years. Our
own feeling is that these end-of-the-world
prognostications should be prohibited
by law.</p>

       <hr class="short" />
<p>
An Oxford professor has made himself
the subject of a series of experiments
on the effects of alcohol. Several
college professors of America quite
readily admit that they never thought
of that one.</p>

       <hr class="short" />
<p>
A correspondent writes to a contemporary
to say that he wears a hat exactly
like <i>The  Daily Mail</i> hat, and
that he purchased it long before <i>The
Daily Mail</i> was started. The audacity
of some people in thinking that anything
happened before <i>The Daily Mail</i>
started is simply appalling.</p>

       <hr class="short" />
<p>
Three stars have recently been discovered
by an American. No, no; not
those stars, but stars in the heavens.</p>

       <hr class="short" />
<p>
"Whilst returning to camp one night
I walked right into a herd of elephants,"
states a well-known explorer
in his memoirs. We have
always maintained that all
wild animals above the size
of a rabbit should carry two
head-lights and one rear-light
whilst travelling after
dark.</p>

       <hr class="short" />
<p>
A small island was advertised
for sale last week. Just
the sort of thing for a bad
sailor to take with him when
crossing the Channel on a
rough day.</p>

       <hr class="short" />
<p>
"Everyone knows," a
writer in <i>The Daily Mail</i>
declares, "that electric light
in the poultry-house results
in more eggs." There may
be more of them but they
never have the real actinic
taste of the natural egg.</p>

       <hr class="short" />
<p>
An American inventor has
devised a scheme for lassoing
enemy submarines. This is a decided
improvement on the method of
just sticking a pin into them as they
whizz by.</p>

Since the talk of Prohibition in Scotland,
we are informed that one concert
singer began the chorus of the famous
Scottish ballad by singing "O ye'll tak

<h2>OUR INVINCIBLE NAVY</h2>.

<h4><span class="sc">Prize-Money</span>.</h4>
<p>
The really intriguing thing about Naval prize-money is
the fact that no one knows exactly where it comes from.
You don't win it by any definite act of superlative daring&mdash;I
mean to say, you don't have to creep out under cover of
darkness and return in the morning with an enemy battleship
in tow to qualify for a modicum of this mysterious
treasure. You just proceed serenely on your lawful occasions,
confident in the knowledge that incredible sums of
prize-money are piling themselves up for your ultimate
benefit. I suppose the authorities understand all about
it; nobody else does. One just lets it pile. It is a most
gratifying thought.</p>
<p>
During the more or less stormy times of the First Great
War, we of the Navy were always able to buttress our
resolution with golden hopes of a future opulence denied
to our less fortunate comrades in the trenches. Whenever
the struggle was going particularly badly for us&mdash;when, for
instance, a well-earned shore-leave had been unexpectedly
jammed or a tin of condensed milk had overturned into
somebody's sea-boot&mdash;we used to console each other with
cheerful reminders of this accumulating fruit of our endeavours.
"Think of the prize-money, my boy," we used
to exclaim; "meditate upon the jingling millions that will
be yours when the dreary vigil is ended;" and as by magic
the unseemly mutterings of wrath would give place to purrs
of pleasurable anticipation. Even we of the R.N.V.R.,
mere temporary face-fringes, as it were, which the razor of
peace was soon to remove from the war-time visage of the
Service&mdash;even we fell under the spell. "Fourteen million
pounds!" we would gurgle, hugging ourselves with joy in
the darkness of the night-watches.</p>
<p>
In the months immediately following demobilisation I
was frequently stimulated by glittering visions of vast
wealth presently to be showered upon me from the swelling
coffers of a grateful Admiralty. During periods of
more or less temporary financial embarrassment I would
mention these expectations to my tailor and other restless
tradespeople of my acquaintance. "Fourteen millions&mdash;prize-money,
you know," I would say confidentially;
"may come in at any time now." I found this had a
soothing effect upon them.</p>
<p>
As the seasons rolled by, however; as summer and winter
ran their appointed courses and again the primrose pranked
the lea unaccompanied by any signs of vernal activity on
the part of the Paymaster-in-Chief, these visions of mine
became less insistent. I was at length obliged to confess
that another youthful illusion was fading; prize-money
began to take its place in my mind along with the sea-serpent
and similar figures of marine mythology. I was
frankly hurt; I ceased even to raise my hat when passing
the Admiralty Offices on the top of a bus.</p>
<p>
That was a month or two ago; everything is all right
again now. I once more experience the old pleasing thrill
of emotion when riding down Whitehall. I have come to
see how ungracious my recent attitude was.</p>
<p>
A chance meeting with Bunbury, late sub-Loot R.N.V.R.
and a sometime shipmate of mine&mdash;Bunbury and I had
squandered our valour recklessly together aboard the Tyne
drifters in the great days when Bellona wore bell-bottoms&mdash;sufficed
to bring me head-to-wind.</p>
<p>
In the course of conversation I referred to the non-fulfilment
of our early dreams; I spoke rather bitterly.</p>
<p>
"And there are fourteen millions somewhere belonging
to us," I concluded mutinously.</p>
<p>
Bunbury regarded me with pained surprise. "Really,
old sea-dog," he said, "this won't do. Never let the
engine-oil of discontent leak into the rum-cask of loyal
memories, you know. Now listen to me. Two years ago
you and I wore the wavy gold braid of a valiant life; we
surged along irresistibly in the wake of <span class="sc">Nelson</span>; we kept
the watch assigned. Does not your bosom very nearly
burst with pride to call those days to mind? It does.
What then? Has it never once occurred to you that the
last remaining link between us and the stirring past is
this very prize-money you are so eager to soil with the
grimy clutch of avarice? Don't you realize that this alone
exists to keep our memory green in the minds of our old
leaders at Whitehall? Picture the scene as it is. Someone
mentions the word 'prize-money.' Immediately the Lords
of the Admiralty reach for their record files and begin
turning over the pages. They come upon the names of
John Augustus Plimsoll&mdash;yourself&mdash;and Horatio Bunbury&mdash;me.
'Ah,' they exclaim fondly, 'two of our old gunroom
veterans&mdash;when shall we look upon their like again?'
Then they get up and go out to lunch.</p>
<p>
"A month or so later the same thing occurs; once more
our names leap out from the type-written page. 'Brave
boys,' they murmur, 'gallant lads! What should we have
done without them in the dark days? They shall have
their prize-money this very&mdash;why, bless my soul, if it isn't
one o'clock!'</p>
<p>
"Surely," pursued Bunbury earnestly, "you appreciate
the fine sentimental value of this one last tie? As long
as our prize-money is in the keeping of the Service we can
still think of it with intimate regard; we can still call ourselves
<span class="sc">Beatty's</span> boys and hide our blushes when the people
sing 'Rule, Britannia.' You must see that this is the only
large-hearted way of looking at the matter."</p>
<p>
"Bunbury, old sailor," I said, swallowing a lump in my
throat, "you have done me good; you have made me feel
ashamed of myself."</p>

      <hr class="short" />
<p>
There can be no doubt that Bunbury is right. I am so
convinced of it that when next my tailor inquires anxiously
what steps are being taken for the distribution of prize-money
I shall put the matter to him just as Bunbury put
it to me. He is certain to understand.</p>

<h3>UNAUTHENTIC IMPRESSIONS.</h3>
<p>
I think the time has come for me to
follow the example of so many other
people and offer to the world a few
pen pictures of prominent statesmen of
the day. I shall not call them "Shaving
Papers from Downing Street," nor
adopt the pseudonym of "The Man
with the Hot Water (or the Morning
Tea)," nor shall I roundly assert that
I have been the private secretary, the
doctor, the dentist or the washerwoman
of the great men of whom I speak.
Nevertheless I have sources of information
which I do not mean to disclose,
except to say that heavy persons who
sit down carelessly on sofas may unknowingly
inflict considerable pain,
through the sharp ends of broken
springs, on those beneath.</p>
<p>
I shall begin naturally with Mr.
<span class="sc">Lloyd George</span>.</p>
<p>
There is probably no statesman of
whom such widely different estimates
have been formed as the present Prime
Minister of Great Britain. I have heard
him compared with <span class="sc">Themistocles</span>, with
<span class="sc">Macchiavelli</span>, with <span class="sc">Mirabeau</span> (I think
it was <span class="sc">Mirabeau</span>, but it may have been
one of those other people beginning
with "M" in French history. Almost
everybody in French history began with
an "M," like the things that were drawn
by the three little girls in the well),
and even with the younger <span class="sc">Pitt</span>. I
have heard him spoken of as a charlatan,
as a chameleon, as a chatterbox,
and, by a man who had hoped that the
<span class="sc">Kaiser</span> would be hanged in Piccadilly
Circus, as a chouser. Almost all of
these estimates are thoroughly fallacious.
Let us take, for instance, <span class="sc">Macchiavelli</span>.
It was the declared opinion
of <span class="sc">Macchiavelli</span> that for the establishment
and maintenance of authority all
means may be resorted to and that the
worst and most treacherous acts of the
ruler, however unlawful in themselves,
are justified by the wickedness and
treachery of the governed. Has Mr.
<span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> ever said this? He
may have thought it, of course, but
has he ever said it? No. When one
considers that besides this dictum <span class="sc">Macchiavelli</span>
wrote seven books on the art
of war, a highly improper comedy, a life
of <span class="sc">Castruccio Castracani</span> (unfinished,
and can you wonder?), and was very
naturally put to the torture in 1513, it
will be seen how hopelessly the parallel
with Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> breaks down.</p>
<p>
Let us turn then to the younger
<span class="sc">Pitt</span>. I have read somewhere of
the younger <span class="sc">Pitt</span> that he cared more
for power than for measures, and was
ready to sacrifice great causes with
which he had sincerely sympathised
rather than raise an opposition that
might imperil his ascendency. That
is just the kind of nasty and long-winded
thing that anybody might say
about anybody. It was by disregarding
this kind of criticism that the younger
<span class="sc">Pitt</span> kept on being younger. But apart
from this, does Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span>
quote <span class="sc">Horace</span> in the House? Never,
thank goodness. How many times did
<span class="sc">William Pitt</span> cross the English Channel?
Only once in his whole life. That
settles it.</p>
<p>
The predominant note&mdash;I may almost
say the keynote&mdash;of the <span class="sc">Prime Minister's</span>
character is rather a personal
magnetism such as has never been
exercised by any statesman before or
after. When he rises to speak in the
House all eyes are riveted on him as
though with a vice until he has finished
speaking. Even when he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="page365" id="page365"></a>[pg 365]</span>
finished they sometimes have to be
removed by the Serjeant-at-Arms with
a chisel. His speeches have the moral
fervour and intensity of one of the
Minor Prophets&mdash;<span class="sc">Nahum</span> or <span class="sc">Amos</span>, in
the opinion of some critics, though I
personally incline to <span class="sc">Malachi</span> or <span class="sc">Habakkuk</span>.
This personal magnetism
which Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> radiates in
the House he radiates no less in
10, Downing Street, where a special
radiatorium has been added to the
breakfast-room to radiate it. Imagine an
April morning, a kingfisher on a woody
stream, poplar-leaves in the wind, a
shower of sugar shaken suddenly from
a sifter, and you have the man.</p>
<p>
It has been said that Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd
George</span> has quarrelled with some of
his nearest friends; but this again is a
thing that might happen to anybody.
Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> may have had
certain slight differences of opinion
with Lord <span class="sc">Northcliffe</span>, but what
about <span class="sc">Henry VIII</span>. and <span class="sc">Wolsey</span>? and
<span class="sc">Henry V</span>. and <i>Falstaff</i>? and <span class="sc">Henry II</span>.
and <span class="sc">Thomas à Becket</span>?</p>
<p>
Talking of <span class="sc">Thomas à Becket</span>, rather
a curious story has been told to me,
which I give for what it is worth. It
is stated that some time ago Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd
George</span> was so enraged by attacks in
a certain section of the Press that he
shouted suddenly, after breakfast one
morning in Downing Street, "Will no
one rid me of this turbulent scribe?"
Whereupon four knights in his secretarial
retinue drew their swords and
set out immediately for Printing House
Square. Fortunately there happened
to be a breakdown on the Metropolitan
Railway that day, so that nothing untoward
occurred.</p>
<p>
I sometimes think that if one can
imagine the eloquence of <span class="sc">Savonarola</span>
blended with the wiliness of <span class="sc">Ulysses</span>
and grafted on to the strength and firmness
of <span class="sc">Oliver Cromwell</span>, we have the
best historical parallel for Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd
George</span>. It ought to be remembered
that the grandfather of <span class="sc">Oliver Cromwell</span>
came from Wales and that the
<span class="sc">Protector</span> is somewhere described as
"Oliver Cromwell <i>alias</i> Williams."
Something of that old power of dispensing
with stupid Parliamentary
opinion seems to have descended to
our present <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span>. There
is one difference, however. <span class="sc">Oliver
Cromwell's</span> famous advice to his followers
was to trust in Divine Providence
"and keep your powder dry."
Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> puts his powder
in jam.</p>

<h2>THE LIGHT FANTASTIC</h2>
<p>
"Dancers are born, not made," said
John.</p>
<p>
"<i>Some</i> are born dancers," corrected
Cecilia, "others achieve dancing."</p>
<p>
"Well, I'm not going to have it thrust
on me any way," retorted John. "I never
have liked dancing and I never shall.
I haven't danced for years and years
and I don't intend to. I don't know
any of these new-fangled dances and I
don't want to."</p>
<p>
"Don't be so obstinate," said Cecilia.
"What you want doesn't matter.
You've got to learn, so you may as well
give way decently. Come along now,
I'll play for you, and Margery will show
you the steps."</p>
<p>
"If Margery attempts to show me
the steps I shall show her the door.
I won't be bullied in my own house.
Why don't you make your brother
dance, if somebody must?" said John,
waving his arm at me.</p>
<p>
"Come on, Alan," said Margery; "we
can't waste our time on him. Come and
show him how it's  done."</p>
<p>
"My dear little sister," I said sweetly,
"I should simply love it, but the fact
is&mdash;I can't."</p>
<p>
"Can't," echoed Margery. "Why
not?"</p>
<p>
"I hate to mention these things,"
I explained, "but the fact is I took part
in a war that has been on recently, and
I have a bad hip, honourable legacy of
same."</p>
<p>
"Oh, Alan," said Margery, "how can
you? Your hip's absolutely fit, you
know it is. You haven't mentioned it
for months."</p>
<p>
"My dear Margery," I said, drawing
myself up, "I hope your brother
knows how to suffer in silence. But
if you suppose that because I don't
complain&mdash;Great heavens, child,
sometimes in the long silent watches
of the night&mdash;"</p>
<p>
"Well, how about, tennis, then?"
said Margery. "You've been playing
all this summer, you know you have."</p>
<p>
"All what summer?" I asked.</p>
<p>
"That's a good one," said John;
"I bet she can't answer that."</p>
<p>
"Don't quibble," said Margery.</p>
<p>
"Don't squabble," said Cecilia.</p>
<p>
"Yes, stop squibbling," said John.</p>
<p>
"I'm not quabbling," said I.</p>
<p>
John and I leaned against each other
and laughed helplessly.</p>
<p>
"When you have finished," said Cecilia
with a cold eye, "perhaps you will
decide which of you is going to have
the first lesson."</p>
<p>
"Good heavens," said John tragically,
"haven't they forgotten the dancing
yet?"</p>
<p>
"We may as well give way, John,"
I said; "we shall get no peace until
we do."</p>
<p>
"I suppose not," said John dismally
"Very well, then, you're her brother
you shall have first go."</p>
<p>
He waved me politely to Margery.</p>
<p>
"Not at all," I said quickly
"Brothers-in-law first in our family&mdash;always."</p>
<p>
"Could we both come together?"
asked John.</p>
<p>
"No, you can't," said Margery.</p>
<p>
"Then we must toss for it," said
John, producing a coin.</p>
<p>
"Tails," I called.</p>
<p>
"Tails it is," said John, walking
across the room to Margery.</p>
<p>
And the lesson commenced.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
"<i>Chassée</i>  to the right, <i>chassée</i>  to the
left, two steps forward, two steps backward,
twinkle each way&mdash;"</p>
<p>
"Five shillings on Twinkle, please,"
I interrupted.</p>
<p>
Margery stopped and looked at me.</p>
<p>
"You keep quiet, Alan," shouted
Cecilia, cheerfully banging the piano.</p>
<p>
"I shall never learn," said John
miserably from the middle of the room,
"not in a thousand years."</p>
<p>
"Yes, you will," encouraged Margery.
"Just listen. <i>Chassée</i> to the right,
<i>chassée</i> to the left, two steps forward,
two steps back, twinkle each way&mdash;"</p>
<p>
"Take away the number you first
thought of," I suggested, "and the
answer's the Louisiana Glide."</p>
<p>
"To finish up," said Margery, "we
grasp each other firmly, prance round,
two bars...."</p>
<p>
"That sounds a bit better," said John.</p>
<p>
" ... then waltz four bars," continued
Margery, "and that's all. Come on,
now."</p>
<p>
They came on....</p>
<p>
"Good," said Margery as they finished
up; "he's doing it splendidly, Cecilia."</p>
<p>
John beamed complacently.</p>
<p>
"I got through that last bit rather
well," he said; "'pon my word, there's
more in this dancing than I thought. I
quite enjoyed that twinkling business."</p>
<p>
"Have another one," I suggested.</p>
<p>
"Don't mind if I do,"said John. "May
I have the pleasure?" with a courtly
bow to Margery.</p>
<p>
They re-commenced.</p>
<p>
"That's right," said Margery; "now
two forward."</p>
<p>
"I must have a natural genius for
dancing," said John, conversing easily;
"I seem to ... Do we twinkle next?"</p>
<p>
"Yes," said Margery.</p>
<p>
"I seem to fall into it naturally."</p>
<p>
"Look out!" shrieked Margery.</p>
<p>
I don't know exactly what happened;
I rather think John got his gears mixed
up in the twinkling business. At any
rate, one of his feet shot up in the air,
he made a wild grab at nothing and
tripped heavily backwards into the
hearth. The piano was drowned in
general uproar.</p>
<p>
John arose with difficulty from the
ashes and addressed himself haughtily
to Cecilia.</p>
<p>
"I can understand that these two,"
he said, waving a black but contemptuous
hand at Margery and myself,
"should scream with delight.
Their whole conception of humour is
bound up with banana-skins and
orange-peel. But may I ask why <i>you</i>
should have hysterics because your
husband has fallen into the fireplace?"</p>
<p>
"'You seemed to fall into it so
naturally,'" I quoted in a shaky voice.</p>
<p>
"Darling," sobbed Cecilia, "I am
trying&mdash;please&mdash;if only you would take
that piece of soot off your nose&mdash;"
She dabbed her eyes and wept helplessly.</p>
<p>
John rubbed his nose quickly and
walked to the door.</p>
<p>
"If you want my opinion of dancing,"
he said bitterly, "I think it's a
low pagan habit."</p>
<p>
"'Twinkle, twinkle, little star,'" sang
Margery.</p>
<p>
"Bah!" said John, and banged the
door.</p>

<h2>GENF AND THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS</h2>
<p>
"Genf," like "Genève," is the Swiss
for "Geneva." It was selected, nearly
two years ago, as the seat of the League
of Nations. In a few days the League
arrives; and I doubt if any person, firm,
company, corporation or league, having
provided itself with a seat, ever waited
so long before it came and sat upon it.</p>
<p>
You will remember a learned treatise
of mine in these pages on the subject of
Lucerne, written in August last, when
our <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> came and sat there.
I make my living by writing up the towns
of Switzerland as one by one they get
sat on. As there are not more than half-a-dozen
eligible
towns in Switzerland,
and as we shall
have exhausted two
of them in less than
half a year, the living
I make is a precarious
one; in
other words I shall
soon be dead. Well,
well! A short life and
a merry one, say I.
You must admit a
touch of subtle merriment
in that word
"Genf."</p>
<p>
To get to Geneva
you provide yourself
with a passport,
a book of rail and
steamer tickets, a
ticket for a seat in
the Pulman car, a
ticket for a berth in
the sleeping-car and
a ticket for the registration
of your
luggage. In short,
by the time you are
in France you will
have had pass through your hands one
passport and eleven tickets; and the
first thing you will do upon settling down
into the French train is to compete and
intrigue to get a twelfth ticket for your
lunch. You will find that this useless
ticket will follow you all the way to
Geneva and will always assert itself
when you are accosted by a ticket inspector.
I even know a traveller who
arrived eventually at the Swiss frontier
with no other paper of identity or justification;
for a passport which should
have given his name, address, motive
for travelling, shape of mouth, size of
nose and any other peculiarities, he
could only tender documentary evidence
of his having eaten the nineteenth lunch
of the first series of the day before.</p>
<p>
Two things catch the eye about
Geneva. In the first place it is on a
lake, and in the second place it is
always brimful of International Unions,
Leagues, Congresses and Conferences.
The lake is navigated in the season by
a fleet of sizeable steamers, and one of
these, a two-hundred tonner, used to
call every morning of the season at
the little pier outside my house to take
me to business, and brought me back
again every evening. By the pier rests
an old, old man whose only duty in life
it is to catch the hawser as it is thrown
from the incoming liner. Twice a day
for four months that hawser was thrown
for the old man to catch, and twice a
day for four months he missed it. I
spoke to him about this on the last
day, and he showed a fine courage
which nothing can depress. Next
season he means to try again. As he
will be out of a job in the interval I am
plotting to secure for him the post of
naval expert to the League.</p>
<p>
Turning from the lake to the international
delegates, who abound in
Geneva, it is to be noted that the last
lot here were the International Congress
of Leagues of Women. Their main
agendum was to pronounce their complete
independence of men. One of
these delegates went for a row on the
lake and fell in. She was pulled out
again by a man.</p>
<p>
You will find that Geneva was nominated
as the seat of the League in the
Peace Treaty of Versailles. Ever since,
the people of Geneva have been busy conjecturing
what the League of Nations
will do upon its arrival in Geneva. It
will do exactly what you and I would
do in similar circumstances. Stepping
out of the station exit it will hurry off
to its hotel. But when Leagues go to
hotels they buy the darned things
outright. I don't know what they do
about notices on the walls; alter some
and remove others, no doubt. The international
delegates will be requested
to ring once for the political expert,
twice for the military expert and three
times for the naval expert. If my old
man gets the last-named job they will
have to ring rather more than three
times if they want him to come up <i>at
once</i>  and discuss schemes for readjusting
the various oceans.</p>
<p>
As to the other usual decorations of
hotel bedroom walls,
the notice will be
removed which informs
all concerned
that the management
will not be held
responsible for valuables,
unless these
be deposited in the
office safe, though
this will not be intended
to indicate
that the new management
has doubts
as to the safety even
of its own safe.</p>
<p>
The "Hôtel National,"
which is the
hotel in question,
was in process of
complete reconstruction
when the purchase
took place. A
bathroom has been
annexed to every
room. Presumably
every international
delegate will have a
suite allotted to his
nation. The question
I ask myself is this, Will he put himself
in the room and his secretaries in the
bathroom, or himself in the bathroom
and the secretaries in the room? And
the answer I make to myself is as follows:
The delegate will appoint the
room to be his room and the bathroom
to be his bathroom and will leave his
secretaries to make the best of things
out in the corridor. The suggestion
you will probably make is that there
are more suites of rooms than nations;
that I must leave you to work out for
yourself. The number of suites of rooms
is ascertainable, but no one seems able
to inform me how many nations there
are. Personally every time I pick up
a newspaper I seem to discover a new
one. However that may be, the nations
are now all formed into their League,
and may the best one win the Cup
Final, say I!</p>

<h3>FOR THE CHILDREN</h3>
<p>
Mr. Punch comes once more, hat in hand, to beg for help
in a good cause. This time he asks the generous aid of his
readers on behalf of the Victoria Home at Margate, of which
Her Majesty the <span class="sc">Queen</span> is Patroness. This Home cares
for invalid children, from very little ones of only a few
months old, to boys of twelve years and girls of fifteen.
There is room for between fifty and sixty of them and they
stay, on an average, for the best part of a year, during
which they receive careful medical attention, and have all
their needs tended, body and mind. Many of them have
lost a leg or an arm and nearly all have some bandaged
limb, yet, with these disabilities, they contrive to learn the
duties of a loyal Scout and are very proud of their uniform.</p>
<p>
The cost of drugs, of surgical dressings and all house-keeping
necessaries has risen enormously and the Home is
compelled to plead for further help. Mr. Punch invites his
readers to send for a report and see for themselves the very
touching pictures which it gives, in an admirable set of
photographs, of the life of these children in their happy
surroundings.</p>
<p>
All communications and gifts should be addressed to the
Secretary of the Victoria Home for Invalid Children, at
75, Denison House, Vauxhall Bridge Road, S.W.</p>

<p>
The method which is being used just now by some of
Mr. Punch's contemporaries to draw attention to their circulations
does not, it will be seen, tend to numerical nicety,
though doubtless it has its advantages from the advertising
point of view. The following items of news are intelligently
anticipated.</p>

       <hr class="short" />
<p>
The licences cancelled in one district in Scotland, as a
result of the recent local veto poll, total exactly half the
number of quires of "returns" of last week's <i>Pawkiesheils
Gazette</i>. It is insignificant.</p>

       <hr class="short" />
<p>
An analysis of the miners' votes in the Lancashire coalfield
proves that there were as many men in favour of rejecting
the Government proposals as would have provided ten readers
for each copy sold (<i>not</i> merely printed) of the last issue of
<i>The Chowbent and Chequerbent Chronicle</i>.  It is magnificent.</p>

       <hr class="short" />
<p>
It is estimated that, if three more distinguished statesmen
and another woman of letters can be prevailed upon to write
piquant reviews of Mrs. <span class="sc">Asquith's</span> autobiography, the sale
of the work will probably greatly exceed the numbers of
copies of the latest Blue Book issued by H.M. Stationery
Office. It is unthinkable.</p>

       <hr class="short" />
<p>
It is confidently expected that, if the protests against a
certain cinema plot can be sustained for a few days longer,
as many people will go to see the show in the first week as
there are feet in the film&mdash;without counting those who
will sneak round for a free view of "The Stage Door of the
Diadem Theatre." It is good business.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>
<p>
<i>Monday, November 1st.</i>&mdash;In response
to a renewed demand for the Admiralty's
account of the Battle of Jutland
the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> made the remarkable
statement that it was very difficult
to get "an official <i>and impartial</i> account,"
but he added that the Government
were willing to publish all the
reports and despatches on the subject
and leave the public to judge.</p>

<p class="note">
Who shall decide, when Admirals disagree?<br />
Why, <span class="sc">Julian Corbett</span>, or the great B.P.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<a href="images/373-1.png"><img src="images/373-1-200.png" width="200" height="280" alt="'ATHANASIUS CONTRA MUNDUM.'" /></a>
<h5>"ATHANASIUS CONTRA MUNDUM."</h5>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Sir Frederick Banbury.</span></p>
</div>

<p>
Owing to the unexpectedly rapid
passage through Committee of the
Government of Ireland Bill last Friday,
the way was cleared for a number of
British measures. Although dealing
with the most diverse subjects they
were alike in one respect&mdash;without exception
they incurred the hostility of
Sir <span class="sc">F. Banbury</span>. Whether it was a
proposal to reduce the dangers of employing
women in lead processes or to
give married women in Scotland the
same privileges as their English sisters
(including the duty of supporting an
indigent husband), or to hold an Empire
Exhibition, or to set up Juvenile
Courts, the hon. baronet found reason
for opposing them all.</p>
<p>
Once or twice he secured the support
of Sir <span class="sc">John Rees</span>, but for the most
part he was <i>Athanasius contra mundum</i>,
maintaining his equanimity even when
Mr. <span class="sc">Hogge</span> advised him to "marry a
Scotswoman;" or Lady <span class="sc">Astor</span> expressed
her regret that he had not women, instead
of bankers, for his constituents.</p>

<p>
The Government had no reason to
complain of his activity, which may
indeed have prevented the intrusion of
more dangerous critics; for despite his
efforts every Bill went through.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<a href="images/373-2.png"><img src="images/373-2-200.png" width="200" height="253" alt="Lord Loreburn." /></a>
<p>"No supporter of Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span>."</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Lord Loreburn.</span></p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Tuesday, November 2nd.</i>&mdash;The most
striking thing in Lord <span class="sc">Loreburn's</span>
speech upon Irish affairs seemed to me
to be his uncompromising declaration
that he was "no supporter of Mr.
<span class="sc">Asquith</span>." He endorsed, however, his
former chief's demand for an independent
inquiry into the reprisals, but
his motion was defeated by 44 to 13.</p>

<p>
Ever since Sir <span class="sc">W. Joynson-Hicks</span>
defeated Mr. <span class="sc">Churchill</span> at Manchester
he has felt it his duty to keep on his
track. Convinced that our policy in
Mesopotamia is due to the <span class="sc">War Minister's</span>
megalomania he is most anxious
to bring him to book. The prospect of
a Supplementary Estimate for the Army
seemed likely to furnish the desired
occasion. But when he pressed Mr.
<span class="sc">Churchill</span> on the subject the alleged
spendthrift airily replied that there was
no hurry; "I do not immediately require
money."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<a href="images/373-3.png"><img src="images/373-3-200.png" width="200" height="328" alt="'OLD GOLLIWOG.'" /></a>
<h5>"OLD GOLLIWOG."</h5>
<p>Mr. <span class="sc">C. B. Stanton</span>
(<i>As viewed by Mr. <span class="sc">Jack Jones</span></i>).</p>
</div>

<p>
The gloom of the daily Irish catechism
was a little brightened by an
interchange of pleasantries between
Mr. <span class="sc">Stanton</span> and Mr. <span class="sc">Jack Jones</span>. On
this occasion the latter had rather the
best of it. "Golliwog!" he shouted in
allusion to his opponent's luxuriant
<i>chevelure</i>. Mr. <span class="sc">Stanton</span> could think of
no better retort than the stereotyped
"Bolshie!" and when Mr. <span class="sc">Jones</span> rejoined
with "You ought to be put into
Madame Tussaud's" Mr. <span class="sc">Stanton</span> was
reduced to silence. But is it not a
scandal that these entertaining comedians
should only get four hundred
a year?</p>



<p>
On the Agriculture Bill Sir <span class="sc">A. Griffith-Boscawen</span>
was faced with an
urgent demand for a separate Wages
Board for Wales. First he wouldn't; it
would be "an exceedingly inconvenient
and expensive arrangement." But the
Welshmen were so insistent that he
changed his mind, and when the vigilant
Sir <span class="sc">Frederick Banbury</span> challenged the
new clause on the ground that it would
impose a fresh charge on the Exchequer
Sir <span class="sc">Arthur</span> was able to convince the
<span class="sc">Speaker</span> that, though there would be
"additional expenditure," there would
be no "fresh charge." Such are the
nice distinctions of our Parliamentary
system.</p>
<p>
<i>Wednesday, November 3rd.</i>&mdash;When
Mr. <span class="sc">Churchill</span>, some sixteen years
ago, crossed the floor of the House, his
man&oelig;uvre was regarded as a portent,
and men talked of "a sinking ship."
It cannot be said that Lord <span class="sc">Henry
Bentinck's</span> sudden appearance among
the Labour Members created anything
like the same sensation, even though he
was joined a little later by Mr. <span class="sc">Oswald
Mosley</span>. Lord <span class="sc">Henry</span> has always derived
his political opinions rather from
his heart than his head, and has lately
developed a habit of firing explosive
Questions at Ministers from his eyrie
behind their backs. They will probably
find his frontal attacks less disconcerting.</p>

<p>
While Lord <span class="sc">Henry</span> was in the House,
off and on, for thirty-four years before
discovering that he was on the wrong
side, Mr. <span class="sc">Mosley</span> has made the same discovery <span class="pagenum"><a name="page374" id="page374"></a>[pg 374]</span>
after an experience of barely as
many weeks. From his new perch he
inquired this afternoon if Government
cement was being sent abroad, to the
detriment of British builders. Dr.
<span class="sc">Addison</span> contented himself with professing
ignorance of any such transaction.
A less serious Minister might
have replied that the Government
needed all their cement to mend the
cracks in the Coalition.</p>
<p>
News that the coal-strike was over
reached the House during the evening.
Mr. <span class="sc">Bridgeman</span>, always cautious, "understood"
that the men had been
"recommended" to go back to work.
Mr. <span class="sc">Adamson</span>, fresh from the Conference,
was much more downright. "The
strike," he said, "has been declared off,
and the men return to
work." So that's that.</p>
<p>
<i>Thursday, November
4th.</i>&mdash;Lord <span class="sc">Salisbury's</span>
complaint that
the Government's policy
in Egypt was
shrouded in more than
Egyptian darkness
brought a spirited reply
from Lord <span class="sc">Curzon</span>,
who declared that
every stage in the negotiations
had been
fully revealed in the
Press. If no definite
decision as to the future
government of
the country had been
published that was
simply because the
Cabinet had not yet
had time to make up
its collective mind.
Judging by Lord <span class="sc">Milner's</span>
subsequent account
of his Mission,
it would appear that
the process will be long and stormy.
The Mission went to Cairo to sound
the feeling of the Nationalists, but for
all practical purposes they might as
well have stopped in London, where
they ultimately interviewed <span class="sc">Zaghlul
Pasha</span> and his colleagues, and obtained
information which materially altered
and softened their previous views. The
best Nationalists were not anti-British,
but simply pro-Egyptian. Lord <span class="sc">Milner's</span>
final appeal, that his piece should
not be hissed off the stage before it had
been heard, sounded a little ominous.</p>
<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">L'Estrange Malone</span> is not very
popular in the House of Commons just
now. When he rose to address a "Supplementary"
to the <span class="sc">War Minister</span> he
was so persistently "boo-ed" that the
<span class="sc">Speaker</span> had to intervene to secure
him a hearing. Mr. <span class="sc">Lowther</span> probably
repented his kindness when it appeared
that Mr. <span class="sc">Malone</span> had nothing more
urgent to say than that Mr. <span class="sc">Churchill</span>
would be better employed in looking
after the troops in Ireland than in reviewing
books for <i>The Daily Mail</i>.</p>
<p>
For the third day in succession Mr.
<span class="sc">T. P. O'Connor</span> essayed to move the
adjournment in order to call attention
to what he called "the policy of frightfulness"
in Ireland. This time the
<span class="sc">Speaker</span> accepted the motion, but the
ensuing debate was of the usual inconclusive
kind. Mr. <span class="sc">Devlin</span> gave another
exhibition of stage-fury. He objected
to the word "reprisals" being used for
the "infamies" going on in Ireland,
declared that the Government were
responsible for all the murders and prophesied
that the present <span class="sc">Chief Secretary</span>,
"with all his outward appearance
of great masculinity," would fail, as
<span class="sc">Balfour</span> and <span class="sc">Cromwell</span>&mdash;the House
enjoyed this concatenation&mdash;had failed
before him.</p>
<p>
In points of detail Sir <span class="sc">Hamar Greenwood</span>
conceded a little more to his
critics than on some former occasions.
He undertook to consider whether the
Government should compensate the
owners of creameries or other property
wrongfully destroyed; and he admitted
that some constables had exceeded their
duty, nine of them being actually under
arrest on various charges. But on the
main point he was adamant. Quoting
the remark of a police-sergeant at Tralee,
"They have declared war upon us and
I suppose war it must be," the <span class="sc">Chief
Secretary</span> said in his most emphatic
tones, "War it will be until assassination
stops."</p>

<h3>STUTTFIELD AND THE REDS.</h3>
<p>
Stuttfield was nothing of a <span class="sc">Nero</span>.
He would never have fiddled while
Rome burned. He would have been
more likely to imagine that Rome was
burning when there was really nothing
more going on than a bonfire. He is
one more example of the pernicious
influence of sensational literature upon
a nervous temperament.</p>
<p>
It all began through Stuttfield finding
a copy of <i>The Daily Blast</i> in a railway
carriage last June. This journal
is printed on white paper, but the tendency
of its contents is ruddy&mdash;that is
to say, it has "Red" leanings. It was
a revelation to Stuttfield.</p>
<p>
"Are people <i>allowed</i> to say such
things?" he asked me
in horror.</p>
<p>
"My dear fellow, no
one takes it seriously,"
I said. "Don't you
worry."</p>
<p>
But Stuttfield did
worry. <i>The Daily
Blast</i> had the same
effect upon him as a
snake has upon a rabbit;
it terrified him,
yet he could not run
away from it. In fact
he became a regular
subscriber and continued
so despite some
rumours that it was
supported financially
by the Rougetanians&mdash;rumours
which required,
and received,
a great deal of explanation.</p>
<p>
Then, through the
offices of his man-servant,
he obtained a
copy of <i>The Volcano</i>.</p>
<p>
<i>The Volcano</i> appears to be in advance
of <i>The Daily Blast</i> in its ideals, and immensely
so in their expression. But
here again I assured Stuttfield that no
one took them seriously. "I don't suppose
they take themselves seriously,"
I assured him. "They want to sell
<i>The Volcano</i>, that's all."</p>
<p>
"Yes," said Stuttfield, "but they do
sell it, and people read it."</p>
<p>
"I expect the circulation's about
two thousand a week," I said consolingly.
But Stuttfield, as I could see,
was not consoled.</p>
<p>
I met him at intervals after that,
and on each occasion he seemed to be
more obsessed with the notion that
the "Reds" would overwhelm us all
shortly.</p>
<p>
"Russia is Red," he whispered; he
always whispers now for fear of being
overheard by a Red agent, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="page375" id="page375"></a>[pg 375]</span>
there was not very much risk of that
in St. James's Street. "And what
about India and China?"</p>
<p>
"Red, black and yellow&mdash;the Zingari
colours," I said ribaldly, and Stuttfield
left me in disgust.</p>
<p>
Then I heard from a friend that he
had sold his cottage at Redhill. This
was a bad sign, and I went to see him.
I found him much worse.</p>
<p>
"You've taken an overdose of <i>The
Volcano</i>," I said.</p>
<p>
He seized my arm with trembling
fingers.</p>
<p>
"The Red Revolution is upon us,"
he hissed.</p>
<p>
I laughed. "Don't you worry about
the Red Revolution. You come out to
lunch."</p>
<p>
He would hardly be persuaded. Clubs
and restaurants would be attacked first,
he thought. If we lunched together it
had better be in an eating-house in Bermondsey.
"I have a disguise," he said,
and disclosed a complete proletarian
outfit.</p>
<p>
"Well, I haven't," I said. "Not that
these clothes of mine will lead anyone
to mistake me for a capitalist. But, so
far as lunch goes, hadn't we better be
killed by a Red bomb at the Fitz than
by tripe in Bermondsey?"</p>
<p>
Stuttfield could not but admit the
sense of this, so we started out.</p>
<p>
It is widely recognised that Flag
Days, however admirable their objects,
have been a little overdone. But it was
sheer bad luck that brought Stuttfield
face to face with a flag-seller just as we
were entering the Fitz. She came at
him with a determined aspect and began
"The Red Cr&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>
It was enough. Poor Stuttfield was
across the pavement and into a taxi
before I could stop him. There was
nothing for me to do but follow him.</p>
<p>
"Where are we going?" I asked.</p>
<p>
"Waterloo," he answered through
blanched lips. I could get nothing more
from him.</p>
<p>
At Waterloo he sprang out, leaving
me to pay the cab, and disappeared into
the station. I followed as quickly as I
could, but he was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>
"Where would he go to hide from the
Reds?" I asked myself. Suddenly I
had an idea about his destination.</p>
<p>
I was right. In the foremost carriage
I found him. I tried to persuade him
to come out, but he clung to the rack.
So I left him. I have not seen him since.</p>
<p>
I hope he feels safe in the Isle of
Wight.</p>

<h3>THE MOTHER-IN-LAW MYSTERY.</h3>
<p>
In a provincial paper I find the following
passage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Counsel stated that the prisoner's mother
was in court. Later he informed the Judge
that he had made a mistake; it was the prisoner's
mother-in-law. A general laugh throughout
the court followed this 'correction.'"
</p></blockquote>
<p>
We have here in a nutshell the case
for traditional communal humour, and
once again we are set to wondering why&mdash;except
possibly to allay some whimsical
twinges of self-respect&mdash;dramatists
ever try to invent new jokes at all.
Even more are we set to wondering why
this particular joke never fails.</p>
<p>
In the present case the injustice
done to an honourable class of women&mdash;that
is to say, those who provide
lovers with their loves (for that is how
these relationships begin)&mdash;was the
greater because no doubt, when the
laughter had subsided a little, every eye
sought for the lady in question. Normally
we have not the opportunity of
visualising the butt at all. It is enough
that she should be mentioned. Nor
would any grotesque details in her costume
or physiognomy make the joke
appreciably better. It requires no such
assistance; it is rich enough without
them; to possess a married daughter
is all that is necessary to cause gusts
of joyful mirth.</p>
<p>
That it is not the lady herself who
is funny could&mdash;no matter how Gothic
her figure&mdash;be proved in a moment
by placing her in the witness-box and
asking her to state her relationship to
the prisoner's wife. She would say, "I
am her mother," and nothing would
happen. But if the question were,
"What is your relationship to the prisoner?"
and she replied, "I am his
mother-in-law," sides would split. Similarly
one can imagine that if the husband's
reply to the counsel's question,
"Who was with you?" had been, "My
wife was with me," there would have
been no risible reaction whatever; but
if the reply had been, "My wife's mother
was with me," the place would have
been convulsed. Of course the true
artist in effect would never say, "My
wife's mother," but "My mother-in-law."
It is the "in-law" that is so
exquisitely amusing and irresistible.</p>
<p>
But both would be the same person:
the gravest thing on earth, it might be,
in every other respect&mdash;even sad and dignified&mdash;but
ludicrous because her daughter
happened to have found a husband.</p>
<p>
To inquire why the bare mention of
the mother of a man's wife should
excite merriment is to find oneself instantly
deep in sociology&mdash;and in some
of its seamiest strata too. While exploring
them one would make the odd
discovery that, whereas the humour
that surrounds and saturates the idea
of a wife possessing a maternal relative
is inexhaustible, there is nothing laughable
about the mother of a husband.
A wife can talk of her husband's mother
all day and never have the reputation
of a wit, whereas her husband has
but to mention her mother and he is
the rival of the Robeys.</p>
<p>
As for fathers-in-law, low comedians
would starve if they had to depend on
the help that fathers-in-law give them.
Fathers-in-law do not exist. Nor do
brothers-in-law or sisters-in-law, except
as facts; but the joke is that they can
be far more interfering (interference
being at the root of the matter, I take
it) than anyone in the world. It is
the brother-in-law who knows of absolutely
safe gilt-edged investments
(which rarely succeed), and has to be
helped while waiting for something to
turn up; it is the sister-in-law who is
so firmly convinced that dear Clara
(her brother's wife) is spoiling the children.
But both escape; while many
really charming old ladies, to whom
their sons-in-law are devoted, continue
to be riddled by the world's satirical
bullets.</p>
<p>
What is to be done about it? Nothing.
Only the destruction of the institution
of marriage could affect it.</p>

<h3>NOMEN, OMEN.</h3>

<h5>(<i>By our Medical Correspondent.</i>)</h5>
<p>
No one who is interested in the
possibilities of psycho-therapy can view
without serious misgiving recent tendencies
in artistic nomenclature. Some
of us are old enough to remember when
the trend was in the direction of
Italianisation; when <span class="sc">Foley</span> became
<span class="sc">Signor Foli</span>; <span class="sc">Campbell</span>, <span class="sc">Campobello</span>,
and an American from Brooklyn was
transformed into <span class="sc">Broccolini</span>. The
vogue of alien aliases has passed, but
it may return, and it is to guard against
the formidable and deleterious results of
its recrudescence that the following suggestions,
are propounded, not merely
in the interests of Gongorism or of
an intensive cultivation of syncretic
euphuism, but in accordance with the
most approved conclusions of psycho-analytic
research.</p>
<p>
It may be urged&mdash;and the objection
is natural&mdash;that there can be little
danger of a relapse in view of the heroic
and patriotic adhesion of some of our
most distinguished artists to their
homely patronymics. No doubt the
noble example of <span class="sc">Clara Butt</span> and
<span class="sc">Carrie Tubb</span> is fortifying and reassuring,
and there are also clamant proofs
that denationalisation is no passport
to eminence. But it would be foolish
to overlook the existence of powerful
influences operating in an antipodal
direction. I confess to a feeling approaching
to dismay when I study the
advertisement columns of the daily
papers and note the recurrence, in the
announcements of impending concerts,
of names of a strangely outlandish and
exotic form. In a single issue I have
encountered <span class="sc">Krish</span>, <span class="sc">Arrau</span>, <span class="sc">Kouns</span> and
<span class="sc">Dinh Gilly</span>. The Christian names of
some of these eminent performers are
equally momentous and perturbing, <i>e.g.</i>,
<span class="sc">Jascha</span>, <span class="sc">Kofza</span> and <span class="sc">Utt</span>.</p>
<p>
My grounds for perturbation are not
imaginary or based on the hallucinations
of a hypersensitive mind. They
are prompted and justified by the
notorious facts, established by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id="page378"></a>[pg 378]</span>
leading psycho-analysts, that, just as
mellifluous and melodious names exercise
a mollifying influence on the activities
of the sub-conscious self, so the
possession or choice of strange or ferocious
appellations incites the bearer, if
I may be permitted to use so commonplace
a term, to live up to his label.</p>
<p>
It is therefore with all the force at my
command that I entreat and implore
singers, players and dancers to think,
not once but twice or thrice, before they
yield to the fascination of the unfamiliar
and adopt artistic pseudonyms calculated
to intensify the "urges" of their
primitive instincts. It is not too much
to say that a singer who deliberately
assumes the name of Pongo, Og or
Botuloffsky runs a serious risk, in virtue
of the inherent magic of names, of
developing qualities wholly unfitted for
the atmosphere of a well-conducted
concert-hall.</p>
<p>
I believe that the question of establishing
a censorship of artists' names
has been seriously considered by Dr.
<span class="sc">Addison</span>, in view of its bearing on public
hygiene, and that he estimates the
cost of staffing the new department as
not likely to exceed seven hundred and
fifty thousand pounds a year. Still, in
these days when State economy is so
needful, it would be better if the desired
effect were attained by the pressure of
enlightened public opinion rather than
by the operations of even so inexpensive
a department as that contemplated by
the <span class="sc">Minister of Health</span>.</p>

<h3>IN FLANDERS FIELDS.</h3>
<p>
These famous verses, which originally
appeared in <i>Punch</i>,  December 8th,
1915, being the work of a Canadian
officer, Lieut.-Colonel <span class="sc">McCrae</span>, who
fell in the War, have been subjected
to so many perversions&mdash;the latest in
a letter to <i>The Times</i>  from a Minister
of the Crown, where the closing lines
are misquoted as follows:</p>

<p>"If ye break faith with those of us who died,</p>
<p>We shall not sleep, though poppies bloom in fields of France"&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>
that Mr. Punch thinks it would be
well to reproduce them in their correct
form:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Between the crosses, row on row,</p>

  <p>We are the Dead. Short days ago</p>

<h3>AT THE PLAY.</h3>

<p class="center">"<span class="sc">Fédora</span>."</p>
<p>
It may or may not be well that the
War has modified our estimate of the
value of life; but it is a bad thing for
the legitimate drama. And in the case
of <i>Fédora</i>  the bloody <i>régime</i> of <span class="sc">Lenin</span>
has so paled our memory of the terrors
of Nihilism that <span class="sc">Sardou's</span> play seems
almost further away from us than the
tragedy of <i>Agamemnon</i>.  In our callous
incapacity to be thrilled by the ancient
horrors of forty years ago we fall back
on the satisfaction to be got out of the
author's dexterity in the mechanics of
his craft.</p>
<p>
And here the critic's judgment is also
apt to be more cold-blooded. He recognises
the crude improbability of certain
details which are essential to the tragic
development of the play. The death of
<i>Count Vladimir</i> (accented on the first or
second syllable according to the temporary
emotion of the speaker) was due to
the discovery of a letter in an unlocked
drawer where it could never possibly
have been thrown, being an extremely
private letter of assignation. The death
of <i>Fédora</i>,  again, was the direct result of
a letter which she despatched to Petersburg
denouncing a man who proved, in
the light of fresh facts learned a few
minutes later, to be the last (or last
but one) that she would wish to injure.
It is incredible that she should not
have hastened to send a second letter
withdrawing her charge; "instead of
which" she goes casually off on a
honeymoon with his brother, and apparently
never gives another thought
to the matter till it is fatally too late.</p>
<p>
However, I am not really concerned
at this time of day with the improbabilities
of so well-established a tragedy,
but only with the most recent interpretation
of it. And let me say at once
that, for the best of reasons, I do not
propose to compete with the erudition
of my fellow-critics in the matter of
previous interpreters, for I bring a virgin
mind to my consideration of the merits
of the present cast.</p>
<p>
<i>Fédora</i>  is the most exhausting test
to which Miss <span class="sc">Marie Löhr</span> has yet put
her talent. The heroine's emotions are
worked at top-pressure almost throughout
the play. At the very start she is
torn with passionate grief for the death
of her lover and a still more passionate
desire to take vengeance on the man
who killed him. When she learns the
unworthiness of the one and the justification
of the other those emotions are
instantly exchanged for a passionate
worship of the late object of her vengeance,
to be followed by bitter remorse
for the harm she has done him and
terror of the consequences when he
comes to know the truth. And so to
suicide.</p>
<p>
I will confess that I was astonished
at the power with which Miss <span class="sc">Löhr</span>
met these exigent demands upon her
emotional forces. It was indeed a remarkable
performance. My only reservation
is that in one passage she
was too anxious to convey to the
audience the intensity of her remorse,
when it was a first necessity that she
should conceal it from the other actor
on the stage. It was nice and loyal
of Mr. <span class="sc">Basil Rathbone</span> to behave as
if he didn't notice anything unusual,
but it must have been as patent to him
as to us.</p>
<p>
Of his <i>Loris</i>  I cannot say too much
in admiration. At first Mr. <span class="sc">Rathbone</span>
seemed a little stiff in his admirably-fitting
dress-clothes, but in the last
scene he moved through those swift
changes of emotion&mdash;from joy to grief,
from rage to pity and the final anguish
and horror&mdash;with extraordinary imagination
and resource.</p>
<p>
Of the others, Mr. <span class="sc">Allan Aynesworth</span>,
as <i>Jean de Siriex</i>,  played in
a quiet and assured undertone that
served to correct the rather expansive
methods of Miss <span class="sc">Ellis Jeffreys</span>,
whose humour, always delightful, afforded
a little more relief than was
perhaps consistent with the author's
designs and her own dignity as a great
lady in the person of the <i>Countess Olga</i>.</p>

<h3>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h3>

<h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</h4>
<p>
I do not think that even the most phlegmatic of Englishmen
could read <i>Francis and Riversdale Grenfell: a Memoir</i>
(<span class="sc">Nelson</span>) without a quickening of the pulses. This is not
to suggest that Mr. <span class="sc">John Buchan</span> has sought to make an
emotional appeal&mdash;indeed he has told the tale of these
devoted brothers with a simplicity beyond praise&mdash;but it is
a tale so fine that it must fill the heart, even of those who
were strangers to them, with joy and pride. I beg you to
read the memoir for yourselves, and see how and why it
was that these twin brothers, from Eton onwards, radiated
cheerfulness and a happy keenness wherever they went.
"Neither," Mr. <span class="sc">Buchan</span> writes, "could be angry for long,
and neither was capable of harshness or rancour. Their
endearing grace of manner made a pleasant warmth in any
society which they entered; and since this gentleness was
joined to a perpetual glow of enthusiasm the effect was
triumphant. One's recollection was of something lithe,
alert, eager, like a finely-bred greyhound." Those of us
who were not personally acquainted with <span class="sc">Francis</span> and
<span class="sc">Riversdale Grenfell</span> will, after reading this Memoir and
the Preface by their uncle, Field-Marshal Lord <span class="sc">Grenfell</span>,
seem to know them intimately. <span class="sc">Francis</span> won the first
V.C. gained in the War, but when he read the announcement
of it in <i>The Gazette</i>  his brother was already killed
and his joy of life was quenched. "I feel," he wrote to his
uncle, "that I know so many who have done and are
doing so much more than I have been able to do for
England. I also feel very strongly that any honour
belongs to my regiment and not to me." In that spirit he
met his death a few months later. In work and sport, in
war or peace, the twins were ardent, generous and brave,
and their deaths were as glorious as their lives were
gracious and radiant. The profits of Mr. <span class="sc">Buchan's</span> book
are to be devoted to the funds of the Invalid Children's Aid
Association, in which the brothers were deeply interested.</p>

       <hr />
<p>
There are certain tasks which, like virtue, carry their
reward with them. No doubt Miss <span class="sc">Eleanour Sinclair
Rohde</span> would be gratified if her book, <i>A Garden of Herbs</i>
(<span class="sc">Lee Warner</span>), were to pass into several editions&mdash;as I
trust it will&mdash;and receive commendation on every hand&mdash;as
it surely must&mdash;but such results would be irrelevancies.
She has already, I am convinced, tasted so much delight in
the making of this, the most fragrant book that I ever read,
in her delving and selecting, that nothing else matters.
Not only is the book fragrant from cover to cover, but it is
practical too. It tells us how our ancestors of not so many
generations ago&mdash;in Stuart times chiefly&mdash;went to the herb
garden as we go to the chemist's and the perfumer's and
the spice-box, and gave that part of the demesne much of
the honour which we reserve for the rock-garden, the herbaceous
borders and the pergola. And no wonder, when from
the herbs that grow there you can make so many of the
lenitives of life&mdash;from elecampane a sovran tonic, and
from purslane an assured appetiser, and from marjoram a
pungent tea, and from wood-sorrel a wholesome water-gruel,
and from gillyflowers "a comfortable cordial to cheer
the heart," and from thyme an eye-lotion that will "enable
one to see the fairies." Miss <span class="sc">Rohde</span> tells us all, intermingling <span class="pagenum"><a name="page380" id="page380"></a>[pg 380]</span>
her information with mottoes from old writers
and new. Sometimes she even tells too much, for, though
she says nothing as to how lovage got its pretty name, we
are told that "lovage should be sown in March in any good
garden soil." Did we need to be told that? Is it not a
rule of life? "In the Spring a young man's fancy...."</p>

       <hr />
<p>
To my mind, amongst the least forgettable books of the
present year will be that to which Mr. <span class="sc">Seton Gordon</span>, F.Z.S.,
has given the title of <i>The Land of the Hills and the Glens</i>
(<span class="sc">Cassell</span>). Mr. <span class="sc">Gordon</span> has already a considerable reputation
as a chronicler of the birds and beasts (especially
the less approachable birds) of his native Highlands. The
present volume is chiefly the result of spare-moment
activities during his service as coast-watcher among the
Hebrides. Despite its unpropitious title, I must describe
it without hyperbole as a production of wonder and delight.
Of its forty-eight photographic illustrations not one is short
of amazing. We are become used to fine achievement
in this kind, but I am inclined
to think Mr. <span class="sc">Gordon</span>
goes one better, both in
the "atmosphere" of his
mountain pictures and in
his studies of birds at
home upon their nests.
To judge, indeed, by the
unruffled domesticity of
these latter, one would
suppose Mr. <span class="sc">Gordon</span> to
have been regarded less
as the prying ornithologist
than as the trusted family
photographer. I except
the golden eagle, last of
European autocrats, whose
greeting appears always
as a super-imperial scowl.
Chiefly these happy results
seem to have been due to
a triumph of patient camouflage,
concerning which
the author suggests the
interesting theory that
birds do not count beyond
unity, <i>i.e.</i>,  if two stalkers enter an ambush and one subsequently
emerges, the vigilance of the feathered watchers
is immediately relaxed. Should this be true, I can only
hope that Mr. <span class="sc">Gordon</span> will get in another book before the
spread of higher education increases his difficulties.</p>

       <hr />
<p>
I should be inclined to call Mr. <span class="sc">Norman Douglas</span> our
only example of the romantic satirist, though, unless
you have some previous knowledge of his work, I almost
despair of condensing the significance of this into a paragraph.
For one thing the mere exuberance of his imagination
is a rare refreshment in this restricted age. His latest
book, with the stimulating title of <i>They Went</i> (<span class="sc">Chapman
and Hall</span>), is an admirable example of this. Certainly no
one else could have created this exotic city with its painted
palaces and copper-encrusted towers, a vision of sea-mists
and rainbows; or peopled it with so iridescent a company&mdash;the
strange princess; the queen, her mother; the senile
king who should have been (but wasn't) her father; <i>Theophilus</i>,
the Greek artist; the philosophic old Druidess, and
the dwarfs who "chanted squeaky hymns amid sacrifices
of mushrooms and gold-dust." Perhaps this random quotation
may hint at the fantastic nature of the tale; it can
give no idea of the intelligence that directs it, mocking,
iconoclastic, almost violently individual. Plot, I fancy, seldom
troubles Mr. <span class="sc">Douglas</span> greatly; it happens, or it does
not. Meanwhile he is far more concerned in fitting a double
meaning (at least) to the most simple-sounding phrase. To
sum up, <i>They Went</i>  is perhaps not for idle, certainly not
for unintelligent, reading; for those who can appreciate
quality in a strange guise it will provide a feast of unfamiliar
flavours that may well create an appetite for more.</p>

       <hr />
<p>
That clever writer, Mr. <span class="sc">A. P. Herbert</span>, would lightly
describe his story, <i>The House by the River</i> (<span class="sc">Methuen</span>), as
a "shocker." But there are ways and ways of shocking.
He might wish to show us the embarrassments of a fairly
respectable member of the intellectual classes, living in a
highly respectable environment, when he finds that he has
committed homicide; and he might make the details as gruesome
as he liked. But there was no need to shock the
sensitive when he made his choice of the circumstances
in which the poet, <i>Stephen Byrne</i>, inadvertently throttles
his housemaid. It is a
fault, too, that his scheme
only interests him so far
as it concerns <i>Stephen</i> and
his society, and that the
horror of the tragedy from
what one may loosely call
the victim's point of view
does not seem to affect
him at all. Otherwise,
even for the sake of brevity,
he could not so flippantly
refer to the body,
sewn in a sack and thrown
into the river, as just
"Eliza." He may argue
that he never thought of
the corpse as a real one
and that the whole thing
was merely an experiment
in imaginative art; but
his details are too well
realised for that, and so
is his admirable picture
of the society of Hammerton
Chase, W., a thin
disguise for a riverside neighbourhood easy to recognise.
I could never get myself quite to believe that <i>Stephen's</i>
friend, <i>Egerton</i>, accessory after the fact, would so long and
so tamely have borne the suspicion of it; but for the rest
Mr. <span class="sc">Herbert's</span> study of his milieu shows a very intimate
observation. If his <i>Stephen</i>, in whom the highest poetic
talents are found tainted with a touch of coarseness, may not
always be credible, the passion for self-expression which
leads him on to versify his own experience in the form of
a mediæval idyll, and so give himself away, is true to life.
But my final impression of Mr. <span class="sc">Herbert's</span> book&mdash;he will
perhaps think I am taking him too seriously&mdash;is that his
many gifts and notably his humour, whose gaiety I prefer to
its grimness, are here exercised on a rather unworthy theme.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
